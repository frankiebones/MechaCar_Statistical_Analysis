1. The vehicle weight was the most likely variable to be correlated to miles per gallon (MPG)

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
2.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
3.
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

## T-Test on Suspension Coils

## Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
