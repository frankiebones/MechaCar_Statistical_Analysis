# Overview 
Utilizing the supplied observations of 50 prototype MechaCars in MechaCar_mpg.csv we are able to use linear regression to predict MPG.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. The vehicle weight was the most likely variable to be correlated to miles per gallon (MPG)
2. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, the p-value was 5.35e-11 which is lower than the signifigance level of 0.05%. Therefore we can reject the null hypothesis.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
3. With the r-squared value of 71% one can say that this model is an effective predictor of mpg for the MechaCar protoypes.
